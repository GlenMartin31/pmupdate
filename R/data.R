#' SYNthetic Prediction Models (SYNPM) and Validation dataset
#'
#' A list containing: (1) information on some (synthetic) existing prediction
#' models (representing those available/published, which we want to validate in
#' another independent dataset); and (2) a synthetic dataset that we wish to
#' validate the models on.
#'
#' @format A list with two elements. \enumerate{\item{The first element is a
#'   data frame with the information about the existing models} \item{ The
#'   second element is the (synthetic) validation dataset on which we want to
#'   validate the existing models. The dataset has 118150 rows and 7 variables:
#'   \describe{ \item{Age}{The age of the individual at baseline} \item{Sex}{The
#'   sex of the individual (M = male; F = female)}
#'   \item{Smoking_Status}{Indicates whether the individual was or is a smoker
#'   (1=previous/ current smoker, 0=non-smoker)} \item{Diabetes}{Indicates
#'   whether the individual has diabetes (1=diabetic, 0=not diabetic)}
#'   \item{CKD}{Indicates whether the individual has chronic kidney disease
#'   (1=chronic kidney disease)} \item{Year}{The year the observation was made
#'   (2016-2021)} \item{Y}{Whether the binary outcome occured (1=yes, 0=no)} } }

#' Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) dataset
#'
#' The Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) study is a
#' single-centre prospective cohort study among patients, newly referred to the
#' hospital with (1) clinically manifest atherosclerotic vessel disease, or (2)
#' marked risk factors for atherosclerosis. Further details on the data can be
#' found here: Simons, P., Algra, A., van de Laak, M. et al. Second
#' Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) study: Rationale and design. Eur J
#' Epidemiol 15, 773â€“781 (1999). https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1007621514757.
#'
#' Interest is in predicting the occurrence of cardiovascular events; this is
#' defined as time-to-event of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death,
#' ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction. The dataset includes those patients
#' enrolled in study between September 1996 and March 2006.
#'
#' Also contains information from the Framingham (Wilson et al.
#' https://doi.org/10.1161/01.CIR.97.18.1837) and PROCAM (Assmann et al.
#' https://doi.org/10.1161/hc0302.102575) existing risk prediction models
#'
#' @format A list, with the information about the existing models, their
#'   baseline hazards and the SMART data, which includes 3873 rows
#'   (observations) with the following variables: \describe{ \item{TEVENT}{Time
#'   of event (days)} \item{EVENT}{Cardiovascular event (0=no, 1=yes)}
#'   \item{SEX}{M = male, f = female} \item{AGE}{Age (years)}
#'   \item{DIABETES}{History of diabetes (0=no, 1=yes)} \item{CEREBRAL}{History
#'   of cerebrovascular disease (0=no, 1=yes)} \item{CARDIAC}{History of
#'   cardiovascular disease (0=no, 1=yes)} \item{AAA}{History of abdominal
#'   aortic aneurysm (0=no, 1=yes)} \item{PERIPH}{History of periferal aortic
#'   aneurysm (0=no, 1=yes)} \item{STENOSIS}{History of periferal vascular
#'   disease (0=no, 1=yes)} \item{SYSTBP}{Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg)}
#'   \item{DIASTBP}{Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)} \item{BMIO}{Body mass

#'   \item{SMOKING}{Smoking status (never/former/current)}
#'   \item{Hypertension_Cat}{Hypertension as categorized by JNC-V definitions}
#'   \item{HDL_Chol_cat}{Categorized high-density lipoprotein cholesterol}
#'   \item{Fam_Hist}{Family history of CVD: not recorded in SMART, so 0 for} }
