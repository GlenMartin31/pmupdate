Description: Evaluate the predictive performance of an existing (i.e. previously developed) 
    prediction/ prognostic model given relevant information about the existing 
    prediction model (e.g. coefficients) and a new dataset (e.g. external 
    validation). The package also implements a range of model updating methods 
    that help tailor the existing model to the local/ new dataset.
