Title: Prognostic Model Updating and Validation
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: c(person(given = "Glen", family = "Martin", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "glen.martin@manchester.ac.uk"),

Description: Evaluate the predictive performance of an existing (i.e. previously developed) 
    prediction/ prognostic model given relevant information about the existing 
    prediction model (e.g. coefficients) and a new dataset (e.g. external 
    validation). The package also implements a range of model updating methods 
    that help tailor the existing model to the local/ new dataset.
