\description{
The Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) study is a
single-centre prospective cohort study among patients, newly referred to the
hospital with (1) clinically manifest atherosclerotic vessel disease, or (2)
marked risk factors for atherosclerosis. Further details on the data can be
found here: Simons, P., Algra, A., van de Laak, M. et al. Second
Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) study: Rationale and design. Eur J

\details{
Interest is in predicting the occurrence of cardiovascular events; this is
defined as time-to-event of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death,
ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction. The dataset includes those patients
enrolled in study between September 1996 and March 2006.

Also contains information from the Framingham (Wilson et al.
https://doi.org/10.1161/01.CIR.97.18.1837) and PROCAM (Assmann et al.
https://doi.org/10.1161/hc0302.102575) existing risk prediction models
